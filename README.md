The following analysis is based on the paper:
http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2018/report/122.pdf

Data taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products



## Remarks after doing the exercise
- I could have used `TfidfVectorizer` from `sklearn.feature_extraction.text` instead of parsing tokens into vectors on my own
